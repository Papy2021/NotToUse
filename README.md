The React app, served as the front end, is linked to the API file (Link below). This app was created using React-Vite, which is a build tool and development server aimed at improving the development process of modern web applications. Vite runs the React app very quickly, allowing you to see all your changes on the screen simultaneously.

To start the application, use the command "npm run dev" in the terminal. The app requires user authentication and provides a registration form for creating an account, as well as a login form. Users without an account cannot access the app or make changes to the data. The provided username and password help the backend generate a Token that grants the user access to the data.
